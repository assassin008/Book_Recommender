# Books Recommender System

## Project Description

This project develops a recommender system for books using the Surprise Python library, leveraging collaborative filtering algorithms to predict user ratings. Our aim is to enhance user experiences by providing tailored book recommendations based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises Goodreads book ratings, featuring user IDs, book IDs, and user-provided ratings on a 1-5 scale. Preprocessing includes filtering out ratings outside this range to ensure data integrity.

## Environment Setup

Ensure Python is installed on your system, then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy surprise
