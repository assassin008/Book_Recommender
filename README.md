# Books Recommender System

## Project Description

This project develops a recommender system for books using the Surprise Python library, leveraging collaborative filtering algorithms to predict user ratings. Our aim is to enhance user experiences by providing tailored book recommendations based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises Goodreads book ratings, featuring user IDs, book IDs, and user-provided ratings on a 1-5 scale. Preprocessing includes filtering out ratings outside this range to ensure data integrity.

## Results

The project demonstrates using Surprise to effectively build and refine a book recommender system. The optimized SVD model, in particular, shows promise in accurately forecasting user ratings, with potential for further enhancement through deeper hyperparameter tuning and model exploration.


## Conclusion

The project demonstrates using Surprise to effectively build and refine a book recommender system. The optimized SVD model, in particular, shows promise in accurately forecasting user ratings, with potential for further enhancement through deeper hyperparameter tuning and model exploration.

## Environment Setup

Ensure Python is installed on your system, then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy surprise
